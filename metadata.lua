It influences certain mechanics in the disaster, how fast the nests grow and send attacks, and a few other misc things.\n\n[h3]Plans:[/h3]\nI plan to develop:\n- Support for non-Shrieker nests (Looking at you Saltu with your Scissorhand Nests)\n- A reward for surviving, based on the species of nest you survived\n- More expeditions or events that let you interact with the nests\n\n[b]This mod does require my Insects Level Up Mod[\\b]',

	'last_changes', 'Update 1.1 Turns out the mod was implemented badly....\n\n1. Bugfix: Multiple disasters cannot trigger in the same save (Possible cause of sluggishness)\n\n2. Removal: Removed complex code that tried to track if a nest was in combat (Possible cause of sluggishness)\n\n3. Bugfix: Corrected math errors causing nests to be ready for an attack in 1-2 in game hours (Causing massive spawning of attackers)\n\n4. Bugfix: Corrected an input to a base game function, which was expecting an input in percentage of player strength. the mod was giving actual player strength (Causing any input above 100 to be a.... "strong" attack.)\nTL:DR This caused massive spawning of attackers, and it is fixed\n\n5. QoL: Lot\'s of logging was added outputs to the mod log and the actual game log, to track if the custom lua functions are causing the sluggishness. \n\n\nAny issues with this.... very complex mod please include the logs so I can track down why.',
