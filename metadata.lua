New mechanics for nests (Shrieker, Scissorhand, and a new Consortium "Nest") that "learns" about the players presence.\n1a. They now consume nearby resources slowly (Unless awoken). To do what? Create more & Evolve their defenders!\n1b. If awoken, those defenders will instead be attacking you!\n\n2. A new looming disaster where a single species attempts world domination!\nThe specific species is semi-random, and there is a semi-hidden way for you to pick the one you want.\n\n3. Four new expedition sites (One for each nest species and a special bonus one) that can be found while exploring. Each with 3 different event chains with negative and positive results! With each event having the ability to influence the nests on the game map.\n\n4. Totally unrelated (I promise) there is a new reward type from expeditions, Tamed animals! Now you can convince and bring home "friends" from afar.\n\n5. Mod settings to set how you want notifications about nearby nests.\n\nBut be warned awoken nests are [b]much[/b] harder to kill.\n\nYour difficulty choice greatly influences how to end the disaster, how fast the nests grow and send attacks, and a few other misc things.\n\n[h3]Plans:[/h3]\nI plan to develop for this mod:\n- New nest types (Shogu, Camel, etc...)\n- Species specific rewards for fending off the disaster\n- More expeditions or events that let you interact with the flora/fauna of the planet\n\n[b]This mod does heavily use and rely on Enemys Evolve mod[\\b]',
